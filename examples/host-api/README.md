# Host API Example

This example exposes the host-side runtime skeleton over HTTP. It is not a new
core module; it shows how a host application can compose:

- `workflowkit` for workflow lifecycle and approval resume.
- `goagent` for the agent run.
- `llmkit` for model routing, model stats, and provider health.
- `artifactkit` for durable payload refs.
- `runkit` for durable agent run audit records and events.

By default, the example creates a temporary runtime directory. Set
`HOST_RUNTIME_HOME` to make workflow state, agent run audit, artifacts, and
llmkit audit survive process restarts:

```text
$HOST_RUNTIME_HOME/
  workflow.db
  agent-runs.db
  artifacts/
  .llmkit/
```

Endpoints:

- `POST /workflows`
- `GET /workflows/{id}`
- `POST /workflows/{id}/approve`
- `GET /workflows/{id}/llm-routes`
- `GET /agent-runs/{id}`
- `GET /llmkit/models`

`GET /workflows/{id}/llm-routes` returns the sanitized llmkit routing audit for
that workflow: effective task profile, selected model/account aliases, provider,
reason, score breakdown, candidate aliases, and outcome metadata such as
success, latency, tokens, and estimated cents. It does not return prompts,
responses, headers, or API keys.

`POST /workflows` accepts optional `run_mode`. The current example implements
only `sync`, which is also the default. `queued` is reserved for a future worker
model and currently returns `unsupported_run_mode`.

`POST /workflows` also accepts optional `task_profile_preset` and
`task_profile` so a host can describe the task before routing:

```json
{
  "id": "wf-review-1",
  "input": "Review this high-risk policy.",
  "task_profile_preset": "high_success",
  "task_profile": {
    "task_type": "policy_review",
    "needs_reasoning": true
  }
}
```

Available presets:

- `simple_local`: simple, low failure cost, local-preferred.
- `balanced`: medium complexity, medium failure cost, cloud allowed.
- `high_success`: hard, high failure cost, cloud allowed, reasoning required.
- `local_only`: simple, low failure cost, local-only.

If both fields are present, `task_profile_preset` provides the base profile and
`task_profile` overrides specific fields. The default profile remains
simple, low failure cost, and local-preferred. Invalid or unroutable profiles
return `invalid_task_profile`; for example, `local_only` plus `complexity:
hard` fails when no local advanced model exists. The routing decision is visible
through `GET /workflows/{id}/llm-routes`.

Run it:

```bash
go run .
```

Set `HOST_API_ADDR` to choose the listen address and `LLMKIT_HOME` to choose the
audit directory. If `LLMKIT_HOME` is unset, it defaults to
`$HOST_RUNTIME_HOME/.llmkit`.
